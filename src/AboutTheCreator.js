            Hi! My Name is Alden Robell M. de Loyola, the creator of this website.

            I am 23 years old, currently working on my first job as a Software Developer. I have a degree of BS Computer Science in UP Cebu. 

            <div>
            I created this website for a couple of goals. One, to build a Career Portfolio in hopes of selling myself higher for future companies. Two, to channel my passion and love for the band and the solo members. Three, to prove my undying support for them - so call this my own version of “fan art”.

            I first listened to IVOS by a friend who recommended me “Hey Barbara”, who I thought during that time was overly pretentious (so I left a dislike button on its YouTube MV, and is still disliked now). I loved their song Mundo. But In My Prison and Bata! Dahan-Dahan were the songs that made me hooked due to my fascination with how Zild managed to keep the band alive with the departure of such a strong frontman that is Unique. But, I became a solid fan when CLAPCLAPCLAP! was released and when I shuffled through the tracks in YouTube on January 17, 2019, my mind opened, my ears were overwhelmed, I was in heaven. And since then, I never stopped listening to their releases. As time goes by, my appreciation for their musical genius and their authenticity as artists increase. I know ALL of their songs. Even the unreleased tracks of Blaster’s upcoming 2nd solo album!

            I hope this website finds you entertainment and a sense of pride for being a fan of their works.
